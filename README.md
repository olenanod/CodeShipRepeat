# üöÄ Drop Ship PO Automation Engine ‚Äì Hackathon Submission

## üß© Team: Code, Ship, Repeat  
**Contributors:** Olena Noda, Emily Teter, Brendon Pagel

## üîç Problem
Drop ship POs using freight methods `KG` or `KC` are excluded from automation due to iSeries system limitations ‚Äî all must be manually reviewed by the Buyer team (2‚Äì3 hrs per PO). This is inefficient and blocks suppliers that could otherwise be fully automated.

---

## üéØ Solution ‚Äì Modular PO Automation Engine
We created a lightweight, standalone engine that:
- Hooks into the flow **after iSeries PO creation**
- Checks if the supplier + ship method is eligible
- If eligible ‚Üí auto-releases
- If not ‚Üí flags for buyer manual review

> ‚úÖ iSeries remains untouched.  
> ‚úÖ Logic is fully config-driven (`suppliers.json`)  
> ‚úÖ Ready for API deployment in Azure

## üìÇ Files
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `PoC_Solution_Design.md` | Full technical design of the solution |
| `automate_po.py` | Python script to simulate PO evaluation |
| `suppliers.json` | Mock supplier automation config |
| `test_po.json` | Sample PO data |
| `api_server.py` | Optional Flask API |
| `Procfile` | Needed for Azure App deployment |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. **Install dependencies:**


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. **Start the API server:**

Run the Flask API server first in the Terminal in project directory
to serve PO evaluation requests. This will start the server (default at http://127.0.0.1:5000).


```bash
python api_server.py
```

3. **Run `automate_po.py` in a separate Terminal window:**
```bash
automate_po.py
```
