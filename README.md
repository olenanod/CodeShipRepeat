# üöÄ Drop Ship PO Automation Engine ‚Äì Hackathon Submission

## üß© Team: Code, Ship, Repeat  
**Contributors:** Olena Noda, Emily Teter, Brendon Pagel

## üîç Problem
Drop ship POs using freight methods `KG` or `KC` are excluded from automation due to iSeries system limitations ‚Äî all must be manually reviewed by the Buyer team (2‚Äì3 hrs per PO). This is inefficient and blocks suppliers that could otherwise be fully automated.

---

## üéØ Solution ‚Äì Modular PO Automation Engine
We created a lightweight, standalone engine that:
- Hooks into the flow **after iSeries PO creation**
- Checks if the supplier + ship method is eligible
- If eligible ‚Üí auto-releases
- If not ‚Üí flags for buyer manual review

> ‚úÖ iSeries remains untouched.  
> ‚úÖ Logic is fully config-driven (`suppliers.json`)  
> ‚úÖ Ready for API deployment in Azure
